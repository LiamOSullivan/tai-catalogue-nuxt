        "Resource abstract": "The Dublin Soil Urban Geochemistry Project is a baseline survey of heavy metals and organic chemicals in topsoils in the greater Dublin area. \nTopsoil is the upper surface layer of the soil and this geochemical baseline survey measures the amount and type of chemicals in these surface soils. These chemicals can be natural or man-made.\nThis project provides maps and data for the chemistry of these urban soils in Dublin. This is important to the protection of human health. Higher amounts of some chemicals in urban soils may affect human health. It will also comply with environmental laws; help land-use planning and urban regeneration.\n\nIt is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas). This soil geochemistry data is shown as points. Each point gives information about where the sample was collected, the type and value of the chemicals that were tested.

        "Resource abstract": "In 2008, following a 2007 pilot study in Roscommon and Offaly, a nationwide research study into the semi-natural grasslands of Ireland commenced. This study involved collecting botanical and environmental data from semi-natural grassland across all 26 counties. A total of 1192 sites were surveyed and 4633 releves (including 89 non-grassland releves) recorded. The semi-natural grassland habitats (GS and GM categories in Fossitt (2000)) within each site were digitally mapped in ArcMap. In addition, five EU Annex I grassland habitats (6210, 6230, 6410, 6430 and 6510) encountered during the project were surveyed, mapped, and their condition assessed. A small number of sites with 6130 were also surveyed but not assessed. Fuzzy analysis was used to analyse the vegetation data and a classification that contained 19 vegetation types has been proposed and documented. Site and releve data have been stored in an Access database and Turboveg, and two ArcMap shapefiles hold site polygon and releve point habitat data.\n\nCoverage by County and year: 2008: Cork and Waterford 2009: Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Longford 2010: Donegal, Dublin, Kildare and Sligo 2011 and 2012: Clare, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow",

        "Temporal reference": "01-01-2007 to 31-12-2011",
        "Lineage": "Habitat maps of the sites were drawn in the field using the colour aerial photograph in the site pack as a base map. A handheld GPS (Garmin GPS 76 with MapSource) was used in the field to accurately map site boundaries, areas of Annex I grassland habitats (Anon. 2007), non-Annex semi-natural grasslands (Fossitt 2000) and semi-improved grassland habitats, particularly where these were not visible on the photograph. The minimum mapping unit for habitats was 400 m2, with a minimum habitat width of 4 m. A habitat map of each site was produced using these data within ArcMap 9.3 Six ArcMap shapefiles were consolidated to create one shapefile containing mapped polygons of all sites surveyed in all years, 2007-2011. This involved several changes to the ISGS shapefile from the pilot study in 2007 in order to bring it in line with the mapping practices applied in subsequent years. Once the changes were applied, all individual shapefiles were standardised to contain identical columns, with data following set labelling conventions. Consolidation of the shapefiles occurred after standardisation. The following data-checking procedures were performed on the consolidated shapefile using ArcMap toolbox and ET GeoWizards: • All polygons and gaps below the minimum mapping size were examined • Slivers and overlapping polygons were identified and investigated • Any attribute lines with no corresponding polygon were eliminated • Relevés lying outside of polygons were examined and addressed • Conformity of all labels to labelling conventions was assured • Label mismatches between relevés and polygons were investigated and addressed, as were label mismatches within polygons • Multi-part features were examined and rendered single-part • A final general geometry check was run. Where anomalies with regard to irregular mapping or mismatching of habitats between relevés and polygons occurred, the original field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the GIS shapefile and/or consolidated Access and Turboveg databases. A separate shapefile created for grassland habitats surveyed and mapped in 2012 was appended to this consolidated shapefile after the 2012 field season, and the checks as outlined above were performed again. Data cross-checking Data checks among the three datasets Shapefile, Access database and Turboveg database were carried out to ensure the integrity of the data within and between them. Any differences were investigated, the original files or field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the datasets. Shapefile attribute fields: SITE_ID: ISGS site number ISGS_HAB: Habitat category according to Fossitt (2000) except that GSiX is used to denote semi-improved grassland habitat. FOSS_HAB: Habitat category according to Fossitt (2000). GA1 is used for semi-improved grassland habitat. ANNEX_I: Code of Annex I grassland habitat given if applicable. If non-Annex, this field has a value of None. MAP_HAB: Grassland habitat that is displayed on habitat map in final pdf layouts. For non-Annex grassland habitats, the value in this field is equivalent to FOSS_HAB (therefore all semi-improved grassland is displayed as GA1). For Annex I grassland habitats, the value is equivalent to ANNEX_I. SURVEYED: Indicates whether the polygon has been walked through and had plant species recorded from it (Yes) or not (No). COUNTY: County in which the polygon is located. SOURCE: Source of data from which polygon is mapped. Most cases are ISGS followed by the year in which it was surveyed. Three polygons were sourced from the grassland monitoring survey data of Dwyer et al. (2007). AREA_M2: Area of the polygon in square metres. X_COORD: X-coordinate of polygon centroid. Y_COORD: Y-coordinate of polygon centroid. COMMENT: Notes on the polygon. RELEVÉS A minimum of one 2 m x 2 m relevé was recorded from within each semi-natural grassland habitat mapped in each site, and in semi-improved grassland habitats deemed to have some conservation merit. Multiple relevés were recorded where there was significant variation in the sward composition within a habitat type, or where Annex I grassland habitat assessments were conducted. For each relevé, a 12-figure grid reference was obtained using a GPS unit. The following data-checking procedures were performed: • Relevés lying outside of polygons were examined and addressed • Label mismatches between relevés and polygons were investigated and addressed • Where anomalies with regard to irregular mapping or mismatching of habitats between relevés and polygons occurred, the original field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the GIS shapefile and/or consolidated Access and Turboveg databases. Shapefile attributes: RELEVE: ISGS releve number (<ISGS site number>_<releve number within site>). HAB_TYPE: Fossitt (2000) habitat in which the releve was recorded, except that semi-improved grassland is denoted GSiX rather than GA1. ANNEX_I: Annex I habitat (if any) in which the releve was recorded. If non-Annex habitat, value of field is None. STOP: Monitoring stop number, if applicable. If the releve is not a monitoring stop, value of field is 0. VEG_TYPE: Vegetation type to which releve was assigned, according to proposed vegetation classification presented in O'Neill et al. 2013 ISGS report. A small number of plots with high-cover genus-level records were not assigned to a vegetation type. Non-grassland releves were also not assigned to a vegetation type. CORE_REL: Value is Y if releve is a core releve used to derive the classification; N if releve is not a core releve used to derive the classification but has been assigned statistically to a VEG_TYPE on the basis of best-fit; N/A if releve is not assigned to a VEG_TYPE. X_coord: X-coordinate of the point. Y_coord: Y-coordinate of the point.",

        "Resource abstract": "In order to distinguish between the urban and rural population for census analysis, the boundaries of distinct settlements need to be defined. This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on OSi mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns. For census reports, urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.",

Soil respiration, the flux of autotrophically- and heterotrophically-generated CO2 from the soil to the atmosphere, remains the least well-constrained component of the terrestrial carbon cycle. The database encompasses all published studies that report at least one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual soil respiration, mean seasonal soil respiration, a seasonal or annual partitioning of soil respiration into its source fluxes, soil respiration temperature response (Q10), or soil respiration at 10 degrees C. The SRDB's orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes, not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements, and the database is dominated by temperate, well-drained forest measurement locations. Version 4 is the compilation of 1458 published studies with measurements taken between 1961 and 2016.",

Web of Science was used to search for publications through the year 2008, and the search terms included soil respiration, soil CO2 evolution, etc. Each study's title and abstract were used to decide whether to acquire it. Approximately 40% of the almost 4700 studies were acquired and examined. \n\nIn Version 2.0, publications from 2009, 2010, and from the first half of 2011 were included and Rs data from 164 studies were added. The Google Earth (*.kmz) file of site locations was updated. Values for the Age_disturbance field were corrected and completed. The Partition_method field was fixed for many records. Finally, three fields Chamber_method, CH4_flux, N2O_flux were deleted because the fields were inconsistent or almost never used.\n\nIn Version 3.0, publications from 2012 and Rs data from a total of 466 new studies were added. Many corrections were made to older data and a new R script for error-checking and mapping was created. The Google Earth (*.kmz) file was removed and the field CO2_method was renamed to Meas_method. Additionally, two new fields titled Meas_interval and Annual_coverage were added.\n\nIn Version 4.0, publications through 2017 were reviewed and more than 1400 observations were added. Many corrections were made to older data.\n\nShort term experiments (i.e., soil respiration measurements made over less than 1-2 weeks) were not entered unless the study authors extrapolated their results to seasonal or annual values; the database is generally not designed to accommodate instantaneous or short-term measurements. In general, no additional research was performed to find older publications that were not listed in the Web of Science. To qualify for inclusion, a study had to report at least one of the following data:\n\nAnnual soil respiration\nMean seasonal soil respiration\nAnnual or seasonal partitioning of soil respiration sources\nQ10 and associated temperature range\nR10 (soil respiration at 10 degrees C)\nIf at least one of these data was reported or could be calculated with few or no assumptions (e.g., easily estimated from points in a figure), the study was entered into the database. For example, sometimes a study will show monthly soil respiration in a figure but not compute an annual flux, and so estimates were made from the figure. This was noted in a quality flag.\n\nWhen it was necessary to calculate or estimate annual flux for one of the studies, these calculations and notes were recorded in an Excel spreadsheet (*.xlsx). File names start with the assigned four-digit “Study_number” that indexes the srdb-studies and srdb-data files (e.g., 0020 WitkampEcology 1966.xlsx and 4634 Webster JGR 2008.xlsx).

The benefited lands identifies land that was drained as part of the Arterial Drainage Schemes, which typically was performed to improve land for agricultural purposes. In the early schemes, large areas of bog were drained which facilitated peat extraction for fuel and horticulture and these are identified separately. Arterial Drainage Schemes were carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 to improve land for agricultural purposes. The Act was amended on a number of occasions, for example to transpose EU Regulations and Directives such as the EIA, SEA, and Habitats Directives and the Aarhus Convention. The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 further allows for the implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection for cities, towns and villages. Statutory Arterial Drainage Maintenance entails the maintenance of completed Arterial Drainage Schemes and completed Flood Relief Schemes. The OPW are responsible for the maintenance of 11,500km of channel, 800km of embankments, some 19,000 bridges and further ancillary structures such as weirs, sluice barrages, sluices, pumping stations and tidal flap gates.\n\nPurpose: This data has been developed to support the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 & 1995, that OPW has a statutory obligation to maintain. These schemes were carried out to improve land for agriculture and to mitigate flooding in urban areas.",

It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. \n\nCLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. Change layers have higher resolution, i.e. minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 5 hectares for Land Cover Changes (LCC), and the minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. The CLC service delivers important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as e.g. protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, monitoring urban land take, assessing developments in agriculture or dealing with water resources directives.

        "Resource locator": "CLC2006 is one of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets produced within the frame the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service referring to land cover / land use status of year 2006. CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as CORINE Land Cover Programme), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. \n\nCLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres.

        "Lineage": "CLC products are based in majority of EEA39 countries on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member and cooperating countries. All features in original vector database are delineated and classified on satellite images according to CLC specifications i.e. with better than 100 m positional accuracy and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5 ha MMU for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). The change layer is derived from satellite imagery by direct mapping of changes taken place between two consecutive inventories, based on image-to-image comparison. Some countries follow alternative approaches by utilizing semiautomatic methodology e.g. generalisation of higher resolution national datasets. Production of national CLC inventories is supported by training and is under systematic control of the CLC Technical Team, both for thematic and semantic aspects, to assure harmonized European products. The process of European data integration starts when national deliveries are accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) issued. National CLC data are then transformed into the common European reference (ETRS89/LAEA) and pan-European seamless dataset is produced. Integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. Rigorous harmonization of country borders has been done only for CLC2000 and CHA9000 layers (in 2 km wide strips along borders) as part of CLC2000 update. Currently, only simplified harmonisation is applied i.e. small border polygons (area &lt; 5 ha) are generalised according to predefined rules to largest and/or thematically most similar neighbour, sliver polygons along borders (&lt; 0.1 ha) are eliminated. European Corine Land Cover seamless database represents the final product of European data integration. Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology and complexity of dataset (adaptive tiling) but this has no impact on dataset contents and can be dissolved for smaller data extracts.\n\n\nRevised versions\nStarted from the publication of CLC2006 (Version 16) the previous inventory is substituted by its revised version by most of the participating countries (see CLC seamless data coverage table https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-1990-2018-v20_1). However, due to their specific methodology not all countries are producing revised version of the previous inventory. The revision of previous CLC layer is a “by-product” of the standard updating process, including corrections to the original data identified during the update. Revisions (correcting mistakes) are needed because of the following factors:\n\navailability of higher resolution satellite imagery;\na new satellite image or time series of satellite imagery provides additional key to correctly recognise a feature;\nimproved availability and better quality of in-situ data;\nimproved skills of experts, i.e. better understanding and application of CLC nomenclature;\ndecision of the national team to improve the product between two inventories.\nThese revisions are not propagated backward to older datasets (e.g. during CLC2018 revision of CLC2012 might be provided, but the older datasets were not revised). Thus, consecutive inventories might include not only real changes, but also differences due to revisions. Therefore, it is recommended that in time series analysis CLC-Change layers should be used. If status layers from past are needed, these could be derived backward from deducting CLC-Change layers from the latest (best available) status layer as it is done for EEA accounting layers (see at eea accounting layers). More details to be available soon in upcoming Users' Manual for all Copernicus data” document.\n\n\nVersion V2020_20u1\n\nFile naming conventions simplified and better described. New file naming convention has been introduced based on user feedback on version 20. Filename is composed of combination of information about update campaign, data theme and reference year and version specification (including release year and release number). \nSee naming convention guide.\n\nThe French DOMs are provided in separate databases (files both for vector and raster version of data).\n\nAll raster layers are back in 8 bit GeoTIFF. Modification is introduced based on the user feedback on version 20. In order to keep 8 bit resolution for raster change layers, they are divided into two files - representing consumption (from) and formation (to) part of change.\n\nSee the CLC Country coverage for full information about the coverage of this version.\nSee the CLC release lineage for full information about lineage history.",

The boundaries recorded in the hydrometric areas map were originally based on the hydrologic divisions shown on the 1958 Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) map - Rivers and their catchment basins. Digitisation was carried out in 1997 from the 1958 source (1:63,360). Attributes are the hydrometric area number (assigned by EPA) and area calculated from the polygons themselves and associated (I)RBD.

Three of these were shared with Northern Ireland (Shannon, Neagh Bann and North Western), four RBDs were wholly within the state (Eastern, South Eastern, South Western and Western) and one was wholly within Northern Ireland (North Eastern).\n\nDevelopment of the river basin management plans has involved a coordinated effort across a wide range of organisations, including a high level of coordination with the authorities in Northern Ireland in relation to the cross-border RBDs.

These maps were digitised between 2001-2004 from Ordnance Survey of Ireland 1:10,560 six-inch raster data in Irish Grid. Distortion arises from the historic Cassini map projection used in the original maps. Scale along the central meridian and at right angles to it is accurate, but everywhere else, scale, and therefore mapped objects, are distorted in a north-to-south direction. The amount of distortion on the map increases with distance from the central meridian. In Ireland, the Cassini projection was applied on a county-by-county basis for six-inch mapping, with the central meridian passing through a point near the centre of the county. Therefore, distortion is most evident near county borders, and also in rivers, lakes and streams. Distortion and error inherent in the dataset are amplified during translation and re-projection using Irish Grid and Irish Transverse Mercator. In general, as channel maintenance work proceeds, some errors may be found and these are corrected on an ongoing basis. In 2019 an exercise was carried out to correct directional issues within the dataset to allow for correct automatic chainage generation.",

        "Resource abstract": "CLC2012 is one of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets produced within the frame the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service referring to land cover / land use status of year 2012. CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as CORINE Land Cover Programme), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. \n\nCLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. Change layers have higher resolution, i.e. minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 5 hectares for Land Cover Changes (LCC), and the minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. The CLC service delivers important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as e.g. protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, monitoring urban land take, assessing developments in agriculture or dealing with water resources directives. CLC belongs to the Pan-European component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/), part of the European Copernicus Programme coordinated by the European Environment Agency, providing environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. Additional information about CLC product description including mapping guides can be found at https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc2018technicalguidelines_final.pdf.

        "Lineage": "CLC products are based in majority of EEA39 countries on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member and cooperating countries. All features in original vector database are delineated and classified on satellite images according to CLC specifications i.e. with better than 100 m positional accuracy and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5 ha MMU for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). The change layer is derived from satellite imagery by direct mapping of changes taken place between two consecutive inventories, based on image-to-image comparison. Some countries follow alternative approaches by utilizing semiautomatic methodology e.g. generalisation of higher resolution national datasets. Production of national CLC inventories is supported by training and is under systematic control of the CLC Technical Team, both for thematic and semantic aspects, to assure harmonized European products. The process of European data integration starts when national deliveries are accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) issued. National CLC data are then transformed into the common European reference (ETRS89/LAEA) and pan-European seamless dataset is produced. Integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. Rigorous harmonization of country borders has been done only for CLC2000 and CHA9000 layers (in 2 km wide strips along borders) as part of CLC2000 update. Currently, only simplified harmonisation is applied i.e. small border polygons (area &lt; 5 ha) are generalised according to predefined rules to largest and/or thematically most similar neighbour, sliver polygons along borders (&lt; 0.1 ha) are eliminated. European Corine Land Cover seamless database represents the final product of European data integration. Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology and complexity of dataset (adaptive tiling) but this has no impact on dataset contents and can be dissolved for smaller data extracts.\n\n\nRevised versions\nStarted from the publication of CLC2006 (Version 16) the previous inventory is substituted by its revised version by most of the participating countries (see CLC seamless data coverage table https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-1990-2018-v20_1). However, due to their specific methodology not all countries are producing revised version of the previous inventory. The revision of previous CLC layer is a “by-product” of the standard updating process, including corrections to the original data identified during the update. Revisions (correcting mistakes) are needed because of the following factors:\n\navailability of higher resolution satellite imagery;\na new satellite image or time series of satellite imagery provides additional key to correctly recognise a feature;\nimproved availability and better quality of in-situ data;\nimproved skills of experts, i.e. better understanding and application of CLC nomenclature;\ndecision of the national team to improve the product between two inventories.\nThese revisions are not propagated backward to older datasets (e.g. during CLC2018 revision of CLC2012 might be provided, but the older datasets were not revised). Thus, consecutive inventories might include not only real changes, but also differences due to revisions. Therefore, it is recommended that in time series analysis CLC-Change layers should be used. If status layers from past are needed, these could be derived backward from deducting CLC-Change layers from the latest (best available) status layer as it is done for EEA accounting layers (see at eea accounting layers). More details to be available soon in upcoming Users' Manual for all Copernicus data” document.\n\n\nVersion V2020_20u1\n\nFile naming conventions simplified and better described. New file naming convention has been introduced based on user feedback on version 20. Filename is composed of combination of information about update campaign, data theme and reference year and version specification (including release year and release number). \nSee naming convention guide.\n\nThe French DOMs are provided in separate databases (files both for vector and raster version of data).\n\nAll raster layers are back in 8 bit GeoTIFF. Modification is introduced based on the user feedback on version 20. In order to keep 8 bit resolution for raster change layers, they are divided into two files - representing consumption (from) and formation (to) part of change.\n\nSee the CLC Country coverage for full information about the coverage of this version.\nSee the CLC release lineage for full information about lineage history.",

        "Lineage": "The forest data series was produced using semi-automatic classification of pre-processed multitemporal High Resolution (HR) satellite image data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8) with reference year 2015 (+/- 1 year), using supervised and unsupervised elements, leading to scene-based initial land cover classifications. Performing of a time series analysis to extract tree cover. Subsequently, interactive manual corrections of the derived tree cover mask have been performed and integrated to a seamless mosaic. Thereafter a mono-temporal, regression-based thematic classification of Tree Cover Density values has been performed on HR_IMAGE_2015, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data using the HRL Forest reference products for calibration and validation. Finally, TCD results have been mosaicked to an area wide pan-European TCD dataset, absolutely calibrated (if necessary) and intersected with the derived tree cover mask. Geometric accuracy (positioning scale): Less than one pixel according to ortho-rectified satellite image base delivered by ESA. The overall thematic accuracy aims to be >90%.\nQuality assurance follows the ISO9000 standards for Quality Management and comprises of dedicated procedures of ongoing quality checks (QA breakpoints) during implementation of the production chain, in order to keep persistent control over the various stages of production, assure fitness-for-purpose of the end-products and that all quality requirements are fulfilled. Priority has been given to the target thematic accuracies to be achieved by each product, as well as to the issues of product consistency (spatial, thematic, temporal) and homogeneity.\n\nQuality Assessment: The quality assessment has been performed according to INSPIRE Data Specifications. The data quality elements considered are:\n(i) Completeness,\n(ii) Logical Consistency,\n(iv) Thematic Accuracy,\n(v) Temporal quality and\n(vi) Usability.\nEach of them (excl. the Thematic Accuracy hereafter) forms a section in the QA/QC Procedures.\n\nThe EPA quality assessment of the Imperviousness data for 2015 is that the overall quality, based on look and feel assessment, is good in urban areas but insufficient in the rural areas of Ireland. In rural areas there is significant settlement in villages and via ribbon development along the national road network, this data is not captured well in the imperviousness data. Statistical verification carried out by the national verification team and based on random point sample assessments highlights a significant level of commission and omission errors. The primary issues were experienced when transitioning to the more rural areas of Ireland but there were also issues identified with mineral extractions sites being classified as impervious areas. It was also noted that there were inconsistencies between different regions of Ireland with some regions having better accuracy than others.",

This study involved collecting botanical and environmental data from semi-natural grassland across all 26 counties. A total of 1192 sites were surveyed and 4633 releves (including 89 non-grassland releves) recorded. The semi-natural grassland habitats (GS and GM categories in Fossitt (2000)) within each site were digitally mapped in ArcMap. In addition, five EU Annex I grassland habitats (6210, 6230, 6410, 6430 and 6510) encountered during the project were surveyed, mapped, and their condition assessed. A small number of sites with 6130 were also surveyed but not assessed. Fuzzy analysis was used to analyse the vegetation data and a classification that contained 19 vegetation types has been proposed and documented. Site and releve data have been stored in an Access database and Turboveg, and two ArcMap shapefiles hold site polygon and releve point habitat data.\n\nCoverage by County and year: 2008: Cork and Waterford 2009: Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Longford 2010: Donegal, Dublin, Kildare and Sligo 2011 and 2012: Clare, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow",

        "Temporal reference": "01-01-2022 to 31-12-2022",
        "Lineage": "Habitat maps of the sites were drawn in the field using the colour aerial photograph in the site pack as a base map. A handheld GPS (Garmin GPS 76 with MapSource) was used in the field to accurately map site boundaries, areas of Annex I grassland habitats (Anon. 2007), non-Annex semi-natural grasslands (Fossitt 2000) and semi-improved grassland habitats, particularly where these were not visible on the photograph. The minimum mapping unit for habitats was 400 m2, with a minimum habitat width of 4 m. A habitat map of each site was produced using these data within ArcMap 9.3 Six ArcMap shapefiles were consolidated to create one shapefile containing mapped polygons of all sites surveyed in all years, 2007-2011. This involved several changes to the ISGS shapefile from the pilot study in 2007 in order to bring it in line with the mapping practices applied in subsequent years. Once the changes were applied, all individual shapefiles were standardised to contain identical columns, with data following set labelling conventions. Consolidation of the shapefiles occurred after standardisation. The following data-checking procedures were performed on the consolidated shapefile using ArcMap toolbox and ET GeoWizards: • All polygons and gaps below the minimum mapping size were examined • Slivers and overlapping polygons were identified and investigated • Any attribute lines with no corresponding polygon were eliminated • Relevés lying outside of polygons were examined and addressed • Conformity of all labels to labelling conventions was assured • Label mismatches between relevés and polygons were investigated and addressed, as were label mismatches within polygons • Multi-part features were examined and rendered single-part • A final general geometry check was run. Where anomalies with regard to irregular mapping or mismatching of habitats between relevés and polygons occurred, the original field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the GIS shapefile and/or consolidated Access and Turboveg databases. A separate shapefile created for grassland habitats surveyed and mapped in 2012 was appended to this consolidated shapefile after the 2012 field season, and the checks as outlined above were performed again. Data cross-checking Data checks among the three datasets Shapefile, Access database and Turboveg database were carried out to ensure the integrity of the data within and between them. Any differences were investigated, the original files or field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the datasets. Shapefile attribute fields: SITE_ID: ISGS site number ISGS_HAB: Habitat category according to Fossitt (2000) except that GSiX is used to denote semi-improved grassland habitat. FOSS_HAB: Habitat category according to Fossitt (2000). GA1 is used for semi-improved grassland habitat. ANNEX_I: Code of Annex I grassland habitat given if applicable. If non-Annex, this field has a value of None. MAP_HAB: Grassland habitat that is displayed on habitat map in final pdf layouts. For non-Annex grassland habitats, the value in this field is equivalent to FOSS_HAB (therefore all semi-improved grassland is displayed as GA1). For Annex I grassland habitats, the value is equivalent to ANNEX_I. SURVEYED: Indicates whether the polygon has been walked through and had plant species recorded from it (Yes) or not (No). COUNTY: County in which the polygon is located. SOURCE: Source of data from which polygon is mapped. Most cases are ISGS followed by the year in which it was surveyed. Three polygons were sourced from the grassland monitoring survey data of Dwyer et al. (2007). AREA_M2: Area of the polygon in square metres. X_COORD: X-coordinate of polygon centroid. Y_COORD: Y-coordinate of polygon centroid. COMMENT: Notes on the polygon. RELEVÉS A minimum of one 2 m x 2 m relevé was recorded from within each semi-natural grassland habitat mapped in each site, and in semi-improved grassland habitats deemed to have some conservation merit. Multiple relevés were recorded where there was significant variation in the sward composition within a habitat type, or where Annex I grassland habitat assessments were conducted. For each relevé, a 12-figure grid reference was obtained using a GPS unit. The following data-checking procedures were performed: • Relevés lying outside of polygons were examined and addressed • Label mismatches between relevés and polygons were investigated and addressed • Where anomalies with regard to irregular mapping or mismatching of habitats between relevés and polygons occurred, the original field data were consulted and the appropriate changes made to the GIS shapefile and/or consolidated Access and Turboveg databases. Shapefile attributes: RELEVE: ISGS releve number (<ISGS site number>_<releve number within site>). HAB_TYPE: Fossitt (2000) habitat in which the releve was recorded, except that semi-improved grassland is denoted GSiX rather than GA1. ANNEX_I: Annex I habitat (if any) in which the releve was recorded. If non-Annex habitat, value of field is None. STOP: Monitoring stop number, if applicable. If the releve is not a monitoring stop, value of field is 0. VEG_TYPE: Vegetation type to which releve was assigned, according to proposed vegetation classification presented in O'Neill et al. 2013 ISGS report. A small number of plots with high-cover genus-level records were not assigned to a vegetation type. Non-grassland releves were also not assigned to a vegetation type. CORE_REL: Value is Y if releve is a core releve used to derive the classification; N if releve is not a core releve used to derive the classification but has been assigned statistically to a VEG_TYPE on the basis of best-fit; N/A if releve is not assigned to a VEG_TYPE. X_coord: X-coordinate of the point. Y_coord: Y-coordinate of the point.",

The geographical coherence of the geochemical results was considered to be predominantly underpinned by underlying parent material and glacial geology. Other factors such as soil type, land use, anthropogenic effects and climatic effects were also evident. The coherence between elements, as displayed by multivariate analyses, was evident in this study. Examples included strong relationships between Co, Fe, As, Mn and Cu. This study applied large-scale microbiological analysis of soils for the first time in Ireland and in doing so also investigated microbial community structure in a range of soil types in order to determine the relationship between soil microbiology and chemistry. The results of the microbiological analyses were consistent with geochemical analyses and demonstrated that bacterial community populations appeared to be predominantly determined by soil parent material and soil type.",

        "Resource abstract": "Stream sediment samples were collected in the southeast of Ireland from 1986 to\n1990. This was part of a baseline geochemical survey, which measured the amount\nand type of chemicals in the stream sediments. The samples were tested for\nlithium and 37 other chemicals.\nAlmost 2,000 stream sediment samples were collected in southeast Ireland from\n1986 to 1990. They were analysed for 38 elements. The data showed the change in\nchemistry of the sediments and bedrock across the region. Most of the samples\nwere analysed again in 2014-2015 as part of the Tellus programme. The new\nanalyses were generally of higher quality. However, lithium was not included in\nthe new analyses.\nLithium is a “critical” element in the European Union. This means it is of high\nimportance to the economy and there is a high risk to its supply. Since it is a\ncritical element it is important for mineral exploration. In southeast Ireland,\nlithium deposits were discovered in the 1970s. In recent years they have been\nthe focus of new exploration and research.\nThe Tellus programme does not plan to reanalyse the southeast Ireland samples\nfor lithium. Therefore, the original analyses from 1986-1990 have been compiled\nfor release.\nThe file includes the original lithium data. Lithium was analysed using the AAS\ntechnique. Each sample has its original sample ID (“GSI_ID”) and its Tellus\nsample ID (“Sample_ID”).\nIt is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and\npolygons (areas). The stream sediment geochemistry data are represented as\npoints. Each point gives information about the identity of the sample, where the\nsample was collected and the concentration of lithium in the sample. This\nincludes:\n• GSI_ID = original sample number (1986-1990)\n• Sample_ID = Tellus sample number (2014-2015)\n• Li_AAS = concentration of lithium in sample (ppm or mg/kg)\nLocation information for the sample site:\n• X_ING = Easting (Irish National Grid coordinate system)\n• Y_ING = Northing (Irish National Grid coordinate system)\n• X_ITM = Easting (Irish Transverse Mercator coordinate system)\n• Y_ITM = Northing (Irish Transverse Mercator coordinate system)\nLithium is very important as it is used in making batteries for electric cars.\nBecause of this, the original lithium data have been compiled into a new\ndatabase.",

        "Resource abstract": "ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past.\n\nERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'.\n\nThe ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields.\n\nThe temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states.

CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as CORINE Land Cover Programme), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. \n\nCLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. Change layers have higher resolution, i.e. minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 5 hectares for Land Cover Changes (LCC), and the minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. The CLC service delivers important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as e.g. protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, monitoring urban land take, assessing developments in agriculture or dealing with water resources directives. CLC belongs to the Pan-European component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/), part of the European Copernicus Programme coordinated by the European Environment Agency, providing environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.

All features in original vector database are delineated and classified on satellite images according to CLC specifications i.e. with better than 100 m positional accuracy and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5 ha MMU for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). The change layer is derived from satellite imagery by direct mapping of changes taken place between two consecutive inventories, based on image-to-image comparison. Some countries follow alternative approaches by utilizing semiautomatic methodology e.g. generalisation of higher resolution national datasets. Production of national CLC inventories is supported by training and is under systematic control of the CLC Technical Team, both for thematic and semantic aspects, to assure harmonized European products. The process of European data integration starts when national deliveries are accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) issued. National CLC data are then transformed into the common European reference (ETRS89/LAEA) and pan-European seamless dataset is produced. Integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. Rigorous harmonization of country borders has been done only for CLC2000 and CHA9000 layers (in 2 km wide strips along borders) as part of CLC2000 update. Currently, only simplified harmonisation is applied i.e. small border polygons (area &lt; 5 ha) are generalised according to predefined rules to largest and/or thematically most similar neighbour, sliver polygons along borders (&lt; 0.1 ha) are eliminated. European Corine Land Cover seamless database represents the final product of European data integration. Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology and complexity of dataset (adaptive tiling) but this has no impact on dataset contents and can be dissolved for smaller data extracts.\n\n\nRevised versions\nStarted from the publication of CLC2006 (Version 16) the previous inventory is substituted by its revised version by most of the participating countries (see CLC seamless data coverage table https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-1990-2018-v20_1). However, due to their specific methodology not all countries are producing revised version of the previous inventory. The revision of previous CLC layer is a “by-product” of the standard updating process, including corrections to the original data identified during the update. Revisions (correcting mistakes) are needed because of the following factors:\n\navailability of higher resolution satellite imagery;\na new satellite image or time series of satellite imagery provides additional key to correctly recognise a feature;\nimproved availability and better quality of in-situ data;\nimproved skills of experts, i.e. better understanding and application of CLC nomenclature;\ndecision of the national team to improve the product between two inventories.\nThese revisions are not propagated backward to older datasets (e.g. during CLC2018 revision of CLC2012 might be provided, but the older datasets were not revised). Thus, consecutive inventories might include not only real changes, but also differences due to revisions. Therefore, it is recommended that in time series analysis CLC-Change layers should be used. If status layers from past are needed, these could be derived backward from deducting CLC-Change layers from the latest (best available) status layer as it is done for EEA accounting layers (see at eea accounting layers).

        "Resource abstract": "CLC2018 is one of the Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets produced within the frame the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service referring to land cover / land use status of year 2018. CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as CORINE Land Cover Programme), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. \n\nCLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. Change layers have higher resolution, i.e. minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 5 hectares for Land Cover Changes (LCC), and the minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres. The CLC service delivers important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Union as e.g. protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, monitoring urban land take, assessing developments in agriculture or dealing with water resources directives. CLC belongs to the Pan-European component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (https://land.copernicus.eu/), part of the European Copernicus Programme coordinated by the European Environment Agency, providing environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.

        "Lineage": "CLC products are based in majority of EEA39 countries on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member and cooperating countries. All features in original vector database are delineated and classified on satellite images according to CLC specifications i.e. with better than 100 m positional accuracy and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5 ha MMU for change layer) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). The change layer is derived from satellite imagery by direct mapping of changes taken place between two consecutive inventories, based on image-to-image comparison. Some countries follow alternative approaches by utilizing semiautomatic methodology e.g. generalisation of higher resolution national datasets. Production of national CLC inventories is supported by training and is under systematic control of the CLC Technical Team, both for thematic and semantic aspects, to assure harmonized European products. The process of European data integration starts when national deliveries are accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) issued. National CLC data are then transformed into the common European reference (ETRS89/LAEA) and pan-European seamless dataset is produced. Integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. Rigorous harmonization of country borders has been done only for CLC2000 and CHA9000 layers (in 2 km wide strips along borders) as part of CLC2000 update. Currently, only simplified harmonisation is applied i.e. small border polygons (area &lt; 5 ha) are generalised according to predefined rules to largest and/or thematically most similar neighbour, sliver polygons along borders (&lt; 0.1 ha) are eliminated. European Corine Land Cover seamless database represents the final product of European data integration. Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology and complexity of dataset (adaptive tiling) but this has no impact on dataset contents and can be dissolved for smaller data extracts.\n\n\nRevised versions\nStarted from the publication of CLC2006 (Version 16) the previous inventory is substituted by its revised version by most of the participating countries (see CLC seamless data coverage table https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-country-coverage-1990-2018-v20_1). However, due to their specific methodology not all countries are producing revised version of the previous inventory. The revision of previous CLC layer is a “by-product” of the standard updating process, including corrections to the original data identified during the update. Revisions (correcting mistakes) are needed because of the following factors:\n\navailability of higher resolution satellite imagery;\na new satellite image or time series of satellite imagery provides additional key to correctly recognise a feature;\nimproved availability and better quality of in-situ data;\nimproved skills of experts, i.e. better understanding and application of CLC nomenclature;\ndecision of the national team to improve the product between two inventories.\nThese revisions are not propagated backward to older datasets (e.g. during CLC2018 revision of CLC2012 might be provided, but the older datasets were not revised). Thus, consecutive inventories might include not only real changes, but also differences due to revisions. Therefore, it is recommended that in time series analysis CLC-Change layers should be used. If status layers from past are needed, these could be derived backward from deducting CLC-Change layers from the latest (best available) status layer as it is done for EEA accounting layers (see at eea accounting layers). More details to be available soon in upcoming Users' Manual for all Copernicus data” document.\n\n\nVersion V2020_20u1\n\nFile naming conventions simplified and better described.

The EGMS ground maps are critical for studying, monitoring, and understanding a variety of deformation phenomena of both natural and anthropogenic origin such as landslides, subsidence, seismic and tectonic activity.\nThe products are obtained from multitemporal, harmonised, and quality controlled interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 images, starting from February 2015, and will be validated against independent ground motion data. Interferometry can provide measurements of displacement since various ground features, as seen by the satellite, act as stable radar reflectors (Persistent Scatterers) against which calculations of their distance can be made.

Since the release of the first ‘WoSIS snapshot’, in July 2016, many new soil data were shared with us, registered in the ISRIC data repository, and subsequently standardised in accordance with the licences specified by the data providers. Soil profile data managed in WoSIS were contributed by a wide range of data providers, therefore special attention was paid to measures for soil data quality and the standardisation of soil property definitions, soil property values (and units of measurement), and soil analytical method descriptions.\n\nWe presently consider the following soil chemical properties (organic carbon, total carbon, total carbonate equivalent, total Nitrogen, Phosphorus (extractable-P, total-P, and P-retention), soil pH, cation exchange capacity, and electrical conductivity) and physical properties (soil texture (sand, silt, and clay), bulk density, coarse fragments, and water retention), grouped according to analytical procedures (aggregates) that are operationally comparable.\n\nFurther, for each profile, we provide the original soil classification (FAO, WRB, USDA, and version) and horizon designations insofar as these have been specified in the source databases. Measures for geographical accuracy (i.e. location) of the point data as well as a first approximation for the uncertainty associated with the operationally defined analytical methods are presented, for possible consideration in digital soil mapping and subsequent earth system modelling.\n\nThe present snapshot, referred to as ‘WoSIS snapshot - September 2019’, comprises 196,498 geo-referenced profiles originating from 173 countries. They represent over 832 thousand soil layers (or horizons), and over 6 million records.

The trained ANN model was then applied to predict mean daily SIF (mW/m2/nm/sr) in OCO-2's gap regions based on MODIS reflectance and landcover. This framework was stratified by biomes and 16-day time steps, to account for the varying plant physiological properties in space and time. SIFoco2_005 accurately preserved the spatiotemporal variations of original OCO-2 SIFacross the globe. Validation of SIFoco2_005 with Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer airborne measurements revealed striking consistency (R2 =  0.72; regression slope = 0.96). The high resolution and global contiguous coverage of this dataset will greatly enhance the synergy between satellite SIF and photosynthesis measured on the ground at consistent spatial scales. Potential applications of this dataset include advancing dynamic drought monitoring and mitigation, informing agricultural planning and yield estimation, and providing a benchmark for upcoming satellite missions with SIF capabilities at higher spatial resolutions.\n\nThe version v8r is the data product presented in Yu et al.
